# Bootstrap Your Own Platform

## Introduction

This guide provides a step-by-step process for bootstrapping your platform running on Kubernetes, including the necessary [prerequisites](prerequisites.md), architecture setup, and deployment instructions. Try to follow the instructions first. If you have any questions or issues, please reach out directly via Teams. If you're interested in the setup details, explore the Wiki pages.

---

## 1. Getting Started

Whether you're running on STACKIT Cloud or STACKIT Edge or other Cloud providers, we recommend you to use Terraform.

For STACKIT we provide dedicated modules and configurations and have a guide on how to use them [on this page.](providers/stackit.md). 

If you already have a Kubernetes cluster without DNS, secrets management, etc., simply disable those services in the `config.yaml` file, which will be generated in the next steps.

### 1.1 Environment Configuration

Refer to the [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md) guide and ensure all non-optional tasks in that guide are completed.<br>
Don't forget to create a new Git repository - all following steps should be executed from within that newly created repository.<br>
The easiest way is to run `kubara` inside the repository (but do not add the binary to Git).

---

### 1.2 Generate preparation files

1. Run this command to scaffold essential setup files:

    ```bash
    kubara init --prep
    ```

    This will generate:

    * A `.gitignore` file to help prevent accidental commits of sensitive or unnecessary files
    * An `.env` file that serves as a template for your environment configuration.
      Fill all placeholders (`<...>`) before running `kubara init`.

2. Update the values inside `.env`

    !!! danger "Handling .env Files"
        `.env` files contain sensitive credentials and must be treated as secrets.
        Never commit a plain `.env` file directly into Git.
        If you really need it in the repository, make sure it is stored in encrypted form only.
        Always add `.env` to `.gitignore` to avoid accidental commits.
        For team collaboration, proven approaches include encrypted `.env` files in the repository, centralized secret management, or helper tools like `dotenv`.
        Important: A plain `.env` file in Git exposes all secrets and must be avoided.

3. Check your values

    !!! warning
        Keep in mind that weak passwords such as `123456` for `ARGOCD_WIZARD_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD` are a bad idea, since your
        platform will be publicly available by default via your DNS zone.



### 1.3 Generate Base Configuration

Initialize your configuration:

```bash
kubara init
```

This command creates a `config.yaml` file based on the values from your `.env`.
If you make changes to `.env` later, you can re-run the command with `--overwrite` to update the configuration.

When using `--overwrite`, only values from `.env` are replaced.
Additional settings in your existing `config.yaml` are preserved and merged.
This currently applies **only to the first cluster entry**.

### 1.4 Validate your `config.yaml` against schema (optional, recommended)

Generate a JSON schema file:

```bash
kubara schema
```

By default this creates `config.schema.json` in your current directory.
You can set a custom output file:

```bash
kubara schema --output custom-config.schema.json
```

For editor integration (e.g. VS Code with YAML language server), reference the schema in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=./config.schema.json
```

### 1.5 Update and Prepare Templates

!!! info
    What is "type:" in `config.yaml`: `hub` is your hub cluster, `spoke` is your spoke cluster [Hub and Spoke Cluster](../4_architecture/architecture_overview.md#hubnspoke)
!!! tip
    Not using STACKIT Edge? Just remove the load balancer IPs from your `config.yaml`.

Example:

```yaml
clusters:
  - name: project-name-from-env-file
    stage: project-stage-something-like-dev
    type: <hub or spoke>
    dnsName: <cp.demo-42.stackit.run>
    privateLoadBalancerIP: 0.0.0.0
    publicLoadBalancerIP: 0.0.0.0
    ssoOrg: <oidc-org>
    ssoTeam: <org-team>
    terraform:
      provider: stackit # currently supported: stackit
      projectId: <project-id>
      kubernetesType: <ske or edge>
      kubernetesVersion: 1.34
      dns:
        name: <dns-name>
        email: <email>
...
```

`ingressClassName` defaults to `traefik`. Set it explicitly when using a different ingress controller.
Each service also accepts an optional `ingress.annotations` map under `services.<service>.ingress.annotations` that is merged with kubara's defaults, allowing you to add controller-specific annotations without overwriting the full set.
User-provided annotations are merged on top using `mergeOverwrite`: equal keys are overwritten, while kubara default keys that are not present in the override remain.

kubara generates resources in two stages:

* **Terraform modules and overlays** to provision infrastructure and the Kubernetes cluster
* **Helm templates** to deploy Argo CD and platform services

If you are not using Terraform, you can skip directly to Step 3.

## 2. Infrastructure Provisioning

Kubara is mainly focused on the Platform Experience and Operations on top of Kubernetes for certain Cloud infrastructure 
services we have built dedicated terraform provider modules and testing support.

Visit one of the following pages to learn more about how to use kubara for setting up the underlying infrastructure as
well:

- [STACKIT](providers/stackit.md)
- More provider support is in the works

If you already have an existing Kubernetes cluster and a secret manager which is supported by external-secrets please
continue with the next section.

---
## 3. Helm

This step extends the service catalog:

* Generates an umbrella Helm chart in `managed-service-catalog/`
* Creates cluster-specific overlays in `customer-service-catalog/`

```bash
kubara generate --helm
```


There are several Helm chart `values.yaml` files with dummy `change-me` values that need to be adjusted.
Example:
```yaml
# ... previous content of yaml file
admin: change-me
# ... rest of yaml
```
Edit the generated files in:
`customer-service-catalog/helm/<cluster>/<chart>/values.yaml`

Source templates are embedded in the binary under `src/internal/catalog/built-in/...`, but you should only edit generated files in your repository.

The chart directories where values usually need review are:

* argo-cd
* cert-manager
* external-dns
* external-secrets
* homer-dashboard
* traefik
* kube-prometheus-stack
* kyverno-policy-reporter
* kyverno
* loki
* longhorn
* metallb
* metrics-server
* oauth2-proxy

### 3.1 Additional value files and CI value files

Every generated app supports:

* `values.yaml` as the main customer overlay file
* optional `additional-values.yaml` for overrides/extra values

kubara's generated ApplicationSet already references both files and ignores missing files, so you can add `additional-values.yaml` only when needed.

Merge behavior reminder:

* maps/dictionaries are merged recursively
* lists/arrays replace previous values completely

CI-specific values can be stored in chart-local CI files (for example `ci/ci-values.yaml`) to keep pipeline-only settings out of runtime overlays.


!!! warning
    **Don't forget to commit and push your changes to Git!**

## 4. Deploying Argo CD

### 4.1 Bootstrap the Hub cluster

!!! warning
    This command requires access to a Kubernetes cluster and, by default, uses `~/.kube/config`.
    To target a specific cluster, provide your own config with `--kubeconfig your-kubeconfig`

For external-secrets, create provider credential secret(s) first (for example via `kubectl create secret ...`), then:

A) **recommended for first bootstrap:** pass a `ClusterSecretStore` manifest to bootstrap with `--with-es-css-file` together with `--with-es-crds`, 

or B) apply your `ClusterSecretStore` manually (only if external-secrets CRDs are already installed on the cluster).

If the namespace does not exist yet, create it once before creating the provider credential secret(s):

```bash
kubectl create namespace external-secrets
```

Example provider credential secret(s) for the `ClusterSecretStore`:

```bash
## Bitwarden
kubectl -n external-secrets create secret generic bitwarden-access-token \
  --from-literal=token="<BITWARDEN_MACHINE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN>"

## STACKIT Secrets Manager
kubectl -n external-secrets create secret generic stackit-secrets-manager-cred \
  --from-literal=username="<USERNAME>" \
  --from-literal=password="<PASSWORD>"
```

Example `clustersecretstore.yaml` for `--with-es-css-file` (templating with `{{ .cluster.name }}` / `{{ .cluster.stage }}` is supported):

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1
kind: ClusterSecretStore
metadata:
  labels:
    argocd.argoproj.io/instance: {{ .cluster.name }}-external-secrets
  name: "{{ .cluster.name }}-{{ .cluster.stage }}"
spec:
  provider:
    vault:
      auth:
        userPass:
          path: userpass
          secretRef:
            key: password
            name: stackit-secrets-manager-cred
            namespace: external-secrets
          username: "<USERNAME>"
      path: "<VAULT_PATH>"
      server: "https://<your-secrets-manager-endpoint>"
      version: v2
```

```bash
kubara bootstrap <cluster-name-from-config-yaml> --with-es-crds --with-prometheus-crds
```

Recommended for the first bootstrap with external-secrets: let kubara apply a templated `ClusterSecretStore` manifest during bootstrap:

```bash
kubara bootstrap <cluster-name-from-config-yaml> \
  --kubeconfig k8s.yaml \
  --with-es-css-file clustersecretstore.yaml \
  --with-es-crds --with-prometheus-crds
```

After a successful bootstrap run, your platform should be operational.

## 5. Access the Argo CD Dashboard

!!! info "Argocd Local Login"
    **Username:** `wizard`  
    **Password:** From `.env` (`ARGOCD_WIZARD_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD`)

1. Start port-forwarding:

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
   ```

2. Open your browser at: [http://localhost:8080/argocd](http://localhost:8080/argocd)

3. Log in with the credentials above.

Enjoy your new platform!

## What's also possible?

This section will be extended in the future to describe not just technical changes,
but also other supported possibilities when bootstrapping.

### Bootstrapping Multiple Hub Cluster

You can bootstrap multiple Hub clusters.
Do **not** reuse the same `config.yaml` file for multiple Hub clusters.

**Why?**
During the bootstrap process, the `.env` file is used to provide credentials.
If you reuse the same `.env` file, you would have to constantly adjust it for each Hub - which is error-prone.

Since version `0.2.0`, this is much easier. You can simply provide a different env file:

```bash
kubara init --prep --env-file .another-env
```
Fill out `.another-env` with the required values. Generate a new config file from it:

```bash
kubara --config-file another-config.yaml --env-file .another-env init
```

This will use the values from `.another-env` to generate `another-config.yaml`.

Render Terraform modules and Helm charts for the new Hub cluster:

```bash
# default: generates both Helm and Terraform
# use --helm or --terraform to generate only one type
./kubara --config-file another-config.yaml generate
```

Finally, bootstrap your additional Hub cluster:

```bash
kubara bootstrap --config-file another-config.yaml --env-file .another-env <cluster name from another-config.yaml> --with-es-crds --with-prometheus-crds
```

## What's Next?

After bootstrapping your platform, you can:

* [Add Argo CD projects](../2_managing_your_platform/add_app_project.md)
* [Add Git repositories](../2_managing_your_platform/add_app_repository.md)
* [Add Argo CD applications](../2_managing_your_platform/add_application.md)
* [Add Argo CD appset](../2_managing_your_platform/add_appset.md)
* [Add SSO Configuration](../2_managing_your_platform/add_sso.md)
* [Add additional spoke clusters](../2_managing_your_platform/add_spoke_cluster.md)
