# Catalogs

This page explains what a catalog is in kubara, how catalog loading works, and how to create your own catalog with the `kubara catalog` commands.

For the list of services kubara ships out of the box, see the [Components Overview](../3_components/components_overview.md). That section documents the **built-in catalog**, while this page explains the underlying catalog mechanism and how to extend it.

## What is a catalog?

In kubara, a **catalog** is a higher-level collection built from Helm charts and Terraform modules.

It lets Platform Engineers describe a set of services and how they fit together, instead of managing raw Helm `values.yaml` files and Terraform variables for each cluster.

You can think of it like this:

- Helm charts are a templating layer over Kubernetes manifests.
- Kubara catalogs are a templating layer over Helm charts and Terraform modules.

The goal is to define service integrations once, then generate the concrete deployment manifests and infrastructure configuration from that definition. Instead of customizing Helm values and Terraform inputs separately for every cluster, you maintain a single Kubernetes cluster entry in your `config.yaml`. Kubara uses that config together with the catalog to generate the final output.

A catalog has two main responsibilities:

1. Define **service metadata** through `ServiceDefinition` files.
2. Provide the **templates** that kubara renders into your repository.

That is different from the generated directories in your repo:

- `managed-service-catalog/` contains generated, reusable Helm and Terraform artifacts.
- `customer-service-catalog/` contains generated, cluster-specific values and overlays.

Those generated directories are the result of `kubara generate`. The **catalog** is the input kubara loads before it generates anything.

## Managing catalogs with the CLI

kubara ships a dedicated `catalog` command group for custom catalogs:

```bash
kubara catalog create my-catalog
cd my-catalog
kubara catalog add widget-dashboard
```

`kubara catalog create` scaffolds a catalog root with:

- `Catalog.yaml`
- `services/`
- `managed-service-catalog/helm/`
- `managed-service-catalog/terraform/`
- `customer-service-catalog/helm/example/`
- `customer-service-catalog/terraform/example/`

`kubara catalog add SERVICE_NAME` must be run from that catalog root and creates `services/SERVICE_NAME.yaml`.

Both catalog names and service names must follow RFC 1123 naming rules: lowercase letters, digits, and `-`, starting with a letter and ending with a letter or digit.

## Built-in vs external catalogs

kubara always ships with a **built-in catalog** embedded in the binary.

That built-in catalog includes:

- service definitions under `src/internal/catalog/built-in/services/`
- template content under `src/internal/catalog/built-in/managed-service-catalog/`

The docs section [Components (Built-in Catalog)](../3_components/components_overview.md) describes the services from that shipped default catalog.

You can extend or override that catalog by passing an **external catalog** with `--catalog`.

Catalog roots created with `kubara catalog create` include a `Catalog.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubara.io/v1alpha1
kind: Catalog
metadata:
  name: my-catalog
```

This is the marker file used by `kubara catalog add` to verify that you are inside a catalog root.

## How catalog loading works

When kubara loads a catalog, it does the following:

1. Loads the built-in service definitions.
2. If `--catalog` is set, loads additional service definitions from your external catalog.
3. Merges both sets by `metadata.name`.
4. Rejects name collisions unless `--catalog-overwrite` is set.

An external catalog can be structured in either of these ways for service definitions:

- `<catalog-root>/services/*.yaml`
- `<catalog-root>/*.yaml`

However, if your catalog also contains custom templates, **pass the catalog root to `--catalog`, not just the `services/` directory**. Otherwise kubara can load the `ServiceDefinition` files, but it will not find your `managed-service-catalog/` or `customer-service-catalog/` template roots.

## What a `ServiceDefinition` controls

Each service in a catalog is defined by a YAML document with:

- `apiVersion: kubara.io/v1alpha1`
- `kind: ServiceDefinition`
- `metadata.name`: canonical service name
- `spec.chartPath`: chart directory used by generated templates
- `spec.status`: default service status (`enabled` or `disabled`)
- optional `spec.clusterTypes`: limit the service to `hub` and/or `spoke`
- optional `spec.configSchema`: OpenAPI schema for service-specific config

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: kubara.io/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceDefinition
metadata:
  name: widget-dashboard
  annotations:
    kubara.io/category: application-management
spec:
  chartPath: widget-dashboard
  status: enabled
  clusterTypes:
    - hub
    - spoke
  configSchema:
    type: object
    properties:
      hostname:
        type: string
        default: widget.example.com
      replicas:
        type: integer
        default: 2
        minimum: 1
```

## What kubara does with those fields

### `metadata.name`

This is the canonical service key used in:

- `config.yaml`
- generated schema output
- catalog merge/overwrite logic

Use **kebab-case canonical names** for new services.

### `spec.status`

This is the **default** state kubara uses when creating service entries for a cluster. Users can still override it in `config.yaml`.

### `spec.clusterTypes`

If this field is set, kubara only includes the service by default for matching cluster types:

- `hub`
- `spoke`

### `spec.configSchema`

This schema is used for service-specific configuration handling.

In practice, it affects:

- generated config schema output
- default values applied to `config.yaml`
- validation of nested `services.<name>.config` fields

For understanding available field types and the OpenAPI v3.0 structure used for `configSchema`. Please read the [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#specifying-a-structural-schema) on how to specify a structural schema. kubara uses the upstream [kubernetes/apiextensions-apiserver](https://github.com/kubernetes/apiextensions-apiserver/blob/master/pkg/apis/apiextensions/types.go) implementation for this feature and therefore fully supports all fields used for creating `CustomResourceDefinitions` as part of Kubernetes Operators.

### `spec.chartPath`

This is the directory name kubara exposes to templates as the service's chart path.

For a Helm-based service, `chartPath: widget-dashboard` usually means the chart lives at:

```text
managed-service-catalog/helm/widget-dashboard/
```

## How template loading works

If your external catalog contains template roots, kubara loads them in addition to the built-in templates.

Supported external roots are:

- `managed-service-catalog/`
- `customer-service-catalog/`

The `services/` directory is only for service definitions. It is **not** part of the rendered output.

During `kubara generate`, kubara renders templates and writes them into your repository, replacing:

- `managed-service-catalog/` with the configured managed catalog output path
- `customer-service-catalog/` with the configured customer overlay output path
- `example` path segments with the current cluster name

Provider-specific template variants are supported only below `terraform/providers/<provider>/`, for example `customer-service-catalog/terraform/providers/stackit/example/infrastructure/main.tf.tplt`.
When `terraform.provider` matches a supported provider name, kubara strips the `providers/<provider>/` path segment and uses that provider-specific file for the generated output path. If a common template and a provider-specific template resolve to the same output path, the provider-specific template replaces the common one; kubara does not deep-merge template files.

If a cluster has no Terraform block or uses `terraform.provider: none`, the default `kubara generate` command skips Terraform templates for that cluster. `kubara generate --terraform` still requires a supported Terraform provider.

Provider directories below Helm paths are not treated as provider-specific overrides. Keep provider-specific Helm behavior in a common values template or in the Helm chart itself.
