# Network: ExternalDNS

## What is ExternalDNS?

With kubara you can deploy **ExternalDNS** into your Kubernetes cluster (see https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns/latest/).  
ExternalDNS ensures that DNS records are automatically created and updated as soon as you define Ingress, Service, or supported Traefik resources with hostnames.

!!! info
    ExternalDNS will be rolled out as a **Helm Chart** when you enable the service in your `config.yaml`.

---

## Workflow

1. **Prepare DNS zone**  
   - kubara generates the necessary **Terraform definitions** (modules and variables) for DNS setup.  
   - You then run **Terraform** yourself to actually create the zone.  
   - If you use your own domain, you must delegate the nameservers of this zone at your registrar.  
   - Provider-specific behavior depends on your DNS platform.

2. **Enable ExternalDNS**  
   - In `config.yaml` you enable the service `external-dns`.  
   - Then you must **rerun kubara** (`kubara generate`) so that Terraform files and Helm values are re-rendered with the new settings.  
   - Configure provider-specific values in:
     - `customer-service-catalog/helm/<cluster-name>/external-dns/values.yaml`
     - optional `customer-service-catalog/helm/<cluster-name>/external-dns/additional-values.yaml`
   - Next steps:  
     - run `terraform apply` to provision DNS resources,  
     - **git commit & push** the Helm chart changes so that Argo CD/Flux deploys them to the cluster.  
   - At this point the ExternalDNS Helm Chart will be deployed from Argo CD in the cluster.  

3. **Automatic records**  
   - When you deploy an application with Ingress or Service including a hostname (e.g. `app.example.com`), ExternalDNS automatically creates the corresponding DNS record in your configured zone.  
   - Changes or deletions are also reflected automatically.

## Configuration in `config.yaml`

### Example

```yaml
clusters:
  - name: my-cluster
    stage: prod

    # Base domain / zone
    dnsName: example.com

    terraform:
      provider: stackit # currently supported: stackit
      dns:
        name: "example-zone"
        email: "hostmaster@example.com"

    services:
      external-dns:
        status: enabled        # <--- enable here
```

### Explanation

- **`dnsName`** → base domain for the cluster  
- **`terraform.dns`** → defines the zone for which kubara generates Terraform code (name and contact email).
- **`services.external-dns.status`** → when set to `enabled`, ExternalDNS is templated into the Helm charts for deployment via Argo CD.
- **provider-specific settings** → configure them in the chart overlay values (`values.yaml` / `additional-values.yaml`).

## DNS Credentials

- DNS credentials are provider-specific and should be stored in your selected secret backend.
- The **External Secrets Operator** can sync those credentials into the cluster.
- The **ExternalDNS Helm Chart** consumes the synced secret for provider authentication.

Depending on your provider setup, credentials may be managed by Terraform, by your secret backend workflow, or manually.
