# Alerts
Alerting is a core component of our observability setup, enabling proactive response to system incidents and anomalies.
For alerting, we use the <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prometheus Alertmanager</a>, 
which is included as part of the <a href="https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kube-prometheus-stack</a> Helm chart. Alertmanager handles alerts sent by Prometheus based on user-defined rules and routes them to various receivers.

It receives alerts triggered by Prometheus based on predefined rules and routes them to configurable receivers such as:

- e-mail
- Microsoft Teams, Slack, Rocketchat
- Webhooks
- Jira
- Opsgenie
- Pagerduty
- Victorops / Splunk On-Call

Here is an overview of how to configure the receiver: <a href=" https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/#receiver-integration-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alertmanager receiver-integration-settings</a>

**Key features:**

- Grouping and deduplication of alerts
- Silencing during maintenance periods
- Routing alerts based on custom labels

This setup enables proactive monitoring and quick response to issues or outages.

### Configuration via `values.yaml`

Alertmanager configuration is managed through the `values.yaml` file located in the `kube-prometheus-stack` directory. This file allows us to define custom receivers and routing logic.

Below is an example `alertmanager.config` section from the `values.yaml` file of the `kube-prometheus-stack`. It demonstrates an advanced routing setup that includes Microsoft Teams (v2), a watchdog receiver (e.g. for UptimeRobot) and a silenced route for informational alerts.

```yaml
alertmanager:
  config:
    route:
      receiver: msteams-notifications  # Default receiver if no route matches

      routes:
        # 1. Silence all alerts named "InfoInhibitor"
        - receiver: "null"  
          matchers:
            - alertname =~ "InfoInhibitor"

        # 2. Route "Watchdog" alerts to UptimeRobot with a short repeat interval
        - receiver: uptimerobot
          repeat_interval: 1m
          matchers:
            - alertname =~ "Watchdog"

        # 3. Route all alerts with severity "warning" or "critical" to Microsoft Teams
        - receiver: 'msteams-notifications'
          matchers:
            - severity =~ "warning|critical"
          continue: true  # Continue to evaluate other routes after this one

    receivers:
      # Microsoft Teams v2 receiver using `msteamsv2_configs`
      - name: 'msteams-notifications'
        msteamsv2_configs:
          - send_resolved: true
            webhook_url: <your-msteams-webhook-url>  # Replace with your real MS Teams webhook

      # Watchdog/Uptime monitoring receiver
      - name: uptimerobot
        webhook_configs:
          - url: <your-uptimerobot-webhook-url>  # Replace with your real UptimeRobot endpoint

      # Null receiver to discard matched alerts
      - name: "null"

    # Optional: Use custom templates for consistent alert formatting
    templates:
      - /etc/alertmanager/config/*.tmpl
```


## Alert Visualization

In addition to automated alert routing and notification, our stack provides **visual interfaces** for viewing and managing alerts.

### Alertmanager UI

The **Alertmanager** component includes its own web interface, accessible via an Ingress at:

```
https://<customer-domain>/alertmanager
```

In this interface, active alerts can be viewed, silenced, and grouped. It also shows alert labels, status, and routing details.

![Alertmanager](../images/alertmanager.jpeg)

!!! tip
    Access to the Alertmanager UI can be secured through your ingress controller (e.g. via authentication middleware).

### Alerts in Grafana

**Grafana** also includes a built-in **alerting dashboard** where both legacy Prometheus alerts and Grafana-managed alerts can be viewed. This allows teams to:

- Browse all firing or pending alerts
- Inspect alert conditions and rules
- Silence or acknowledge alerts
- Track alert history and evaluation results

You can access this via **Alerting > Alert Rules** in the Grafana sidebar.

You can find more about Grafana in the [Dashboards](../5_components/observability_dashboards.md) chapter.

!!! tip
    The unified alerting system in Grafana supports rule grouping, templating, and annotations.

### Alerts in the Prometheus UI

Prometheus itself also includes a simple interface for viewing alert rules and their current state.

This can be accessed at:

```
https://<customer-domain>/prometheus/alerts
```

Here, you can inspect all configured alerting rules, including:

- Current state (inactive, pending, firing)
- Evaluation expressions (PromQL)
- Labels and annotations

This view is especially useful for debugging rule evaluations directly at the source.
