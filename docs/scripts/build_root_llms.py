"""Generate the site-root ``/llms.txt`` from the deployed default version.

mike publishes each docs version under ``/<version>/`` and leaves the site root
as a redirect stub, so there is no real ``/llms.txt`` at the conventional
discovery path (crawlers and agents probe the root, like ``robots.txt``). This
script writes one.

The default alias (e.g. ``latest-stable``) is a moving target — it is a symlink
that points at whatever version is current — so linking the site-root index at
``/latest-stable/...`` would hand out evergreen URLs whose content drifts and
can 404 once a page is renamed or removed. Instead this script resolves the
alias to its concrete version via ``versions.json`` and links at version
permalinks (``/<version>/...``), which stay valid. The live ``/llms.txt`` is
regenerated on every stable release, so it always advertises the newest
version.

Concretely it resolves the alias to a concrete version, reads that version's
per-version ``llms.txt`` (which has root-relative links), and rewrites those
links to absolute URLs into ``/<version>/`` so they resolve from the site root.
(Version enumeration is left to mike's ``versions.json``, served at the root.)

It is meant to run against a checked-out ``gh-pages`` worktree, after
``mike set-default``. Uses only the standard library.

Usage:
    build_root_llms.py <gh-pages-dir> [--site-url URL] [--default ALIAS]
                       [--allow-missing-default]
